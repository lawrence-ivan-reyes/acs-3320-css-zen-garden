# CSS Zen Garden

CSS Zen Garden is a project that demonstrates how the same HTML can be styled in completely different ways using only CSS. The HTML structure remains fixed, while the CSS stylesheet (`style.css`) can be completely redesigned to create unique visual experiences.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The fixed HTML structure that serves as the foundation
- `style.css` - The CSS stylesheet that defines the visual design
